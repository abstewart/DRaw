# Client

A client has approached with the following [statement of work (a.k.a. SOW)](./sow.md) (which is intentionally vague) for a 6-week contract. You haven't worked with this client previously, but you want to impress them with your newly assembled team. Review the [statement of work](./sow.md), self-organize, and begin!

**Note** The client does not want you to publicly share this repository of code outside your team, but you may share your YouTube video on your resume/portfolio as you like!

# Logistics

Your project has been divided into several [milestones](./milestones). It will be up to you and your group to self-organize and complete each milestone. The milestones are somewhat linear, though they need not be completed in order. 

## Universal Resources

You will be using the following tools in your project. 

* DLang
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [dub](https://code.dlang.org/)
* unittest and/or [unit-threaded](https://code.dlang.org/packages/unit-threaded)
* A GUI library such as: [gtkD](https://gtkd.org/) (recommended)
