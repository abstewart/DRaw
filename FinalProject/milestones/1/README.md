# Use Cases

Take another look at the [Statement of Work](./../../sow.md). Read through it carefully and start identifying various tasks that you think will complete the deliverable. Note it will also be reasonable to look through all the other [milestones](./../) and start gathering tasks you think need to be completed.

## Task

1. Within this repository on GitHub.com click on the 'Projects' pane (at the top of the window) and create at least 4 columns: 'Tasks', 'In Progress', 'QA', and 'Completed'
	- You may add more at your discretion, but I advise these 4.
2. With your team members, add at least **10 tasks** to that you think you will need to complete. 
	- Note, you can formally add some details of each task like a user story, but that is not required (A case file is included in this directory as an example of details you could add). 
		- Tasks should be descriptive enough however that they can be understood by other team members who have not written the specific task.
