# Testing

- Testing Tasks
  - [X] Make sure there are at least 8 tests written.
  	- At least one test should be networking.
	- At least one test should be for your extra feature.
  - [X] Make sure you have a GitHub action that runs all of your tests on 'push'.
  	- That means you will integrate unit-threaded or unittests into your project, and have the test executable run every time you do a push.
