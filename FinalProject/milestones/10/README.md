# Video
    
You must provide a YouTube video to the client of your project working.    
    
- [x] Create a YouTube video of your final project working.
	- This video should be no greater than 5 minutes in length. 
	- Consider it a portfolio piece to the client showing off how your software works and what technologies you used. 
	- Note: There should be some audio of you or your entire team covering an introduction to your project, showing off some code of your extra feature, discussion of how you figured out what to test, and how you would improve upon the project in the future.
	- **Put you video link here** : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfklO1Npwd0

## Additional notes

- Make sure I can view your video! (i.e. do not make it private)
  - Hint: You can test to see if I would be able to view it by viewing your video in a private browser or incognito mode.
